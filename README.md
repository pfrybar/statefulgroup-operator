# statefulgroup

POC operator for a "StatefulGroup" resource.

This resource consists of a group of StatefulSets with an identical spec. It supports scaling up/down
and configurable rolling deployments.

Note - for now the rolling deployment can only be done one group at a time.

## Description

To run the operator, get a minikube/kind cluster and run the following:
```sh
make manifests && make install
make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```

Once the operator is running, try applying the test manifest:
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/statefulgroup.yaml
```

You should see the StatefulSets and Pods spin up. You can use `kubectl get all` to see all the resources and `kubectl get statefulgroup` to see the custom resource.

The operator implements the `scale` subresource, so you can scale like:
```sh
kubectl scale statefulgroup my-stateful-group --replicas=5
```

To trigger a redeploy/restart of all StatefulSets (and Pods), you can add an extra label to the StatefulSet template as follows:
```sh
kubectl patch statefulgroup nginx-group --type=merge -p "{\"spec\": {\"statefulSetTemplate\": {\"template\": {\"metadata\": {\"labels\": {\"redeploy\": \"$(date +%s)\"}}}}}}"
```

This will proceed one StatefulSet at a time (rolling deploy).

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/statefulgroup:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/statefulgroup:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
